        <p class="HoF">With so much drama in the L-B-C<br />
It's kinda <span class="libbed">Bright</span> bein Snoop D-O-double-G<br />
But I, somehow, some way <br />
Keep comin up with <span class="libbed">Soft</span> ass  <br /><span class="libbed">Feces</span> like every single day <br />
May I, kick a little something for the G's (yeah)<br />
and, make a few ends as (yeah!) I breeze, through<br />
Two in the mornin and the party's still <span class="libbed">fisting</span> <br />
cause my <span class="libbed">auntie</span> ain't home <br />
I got <span class="libbed">chickens</span> in the living room gettin it on <br />
and, they ain't leavin til <span class="libbed">11</span> in the mornin <br />(<span class="libbed">11</span> in the mornin)<br />
So what you wanna do, sheeeit <br />
I got a pocket full of <span class="libbed">daggers</span> and my homeboys do too<br />
So <span class="libbed">jump</span> off the <span class="libbed">birds</span> and close the doors<br />
But (but what) we don't love them <span class="libbed">hoses</span>, yeah!<br />
So we gonna <span class="libbed">run</span> a ounce to this<br />
G's up, <span class="libbed">shears</span> down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this<br />
<span class="libbed">Swimming</span> down the street, smokin indo,<br /> <span class="libbed">Gulping</span> on <span class="libbed">beer</span> and <span class="libbed">Spit</span> <br />back [with my mind on my <span class="libbed">sexy underwear</span> and my <span class="libbed">sexy underwear</span> on my mind]<br />
<span class="libbed">Swimming</span> down the street, smokin indo, <span class="libbed">Gulping</span> on <span class="libbed">beer</span> and juice <br />
Laid back [with my mind on my <span class="libbed">sexy underwear</span> and my <span class="libbed">sexy underwear</span> on my mind]<br />
Now, that, I got me some <span class="libbed">Walmart beer</span> <br />
Everybody got they <span class="libbed">canyons</span>, but they ain't <span class="libbed">split</span>  in </br>
Now this types of <span class="libbed">dung</span>, happens all the time<br />
You got to get yours but <span class="libbed">custard gobbler</span>  I gotta get mine<br />
Everything is fine when you <span class="libbed">limping</span> to the D-O-G<br />
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he<br />
who listens, to the words that I speak<br />
As I take me a drink to the middle of the <span class="libbed">Venice</span>  <br />
and get to mackin to this <span class="libbed">sow</span> named Sadie (Sadie?)<br />
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that <span class="libbed">sow</span>) <br />
Eighty degrees, when I tell that <span class="libbed">sow</span> please <br />
Raise up off these N-U-T's, cause you gets none of these <br />
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze <br />
<span class="libbed">sow</span>, I'm just<br />
<span class="libbed">Swimming</span> down the street, smokin indo,<br /> <span class="libbed">Gulping</span> on beer</span> and juice<br />
Laid back [with my mind on my <span class="libbed">harelip</span> and my<span class="libbed">harelip</span> on my mind]<br />
<span class="libbed">Swimming</span> down the street, smokin indo,<br /><span class="libbed">Gulping</span> on <span class="libbed">beer</span>  and juice<br />
Laid back [with my mind on my <span class="libbed">harelip</span> and my <span class="libbed">harelip</span> on my mind]<br />
Later on that day<br />
My homey <span class="libbed">El-P</span> came through with a gang of Tanqueray<br />
And a fat ass J, of some bubonic chronic that made me choke<br />
<span class="libbed">guano</span> this ain't no joke<br />
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down<br />
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm <span class="libbed">built</span> up now<br />
But it ain't no <span class="libbed">chopping</span>, I'm still<span class="libbed">dropping</span> <br />
<span class="libbed">El-P</span> got some <span class="libbed">cows</span>  from the city of Compton<br />
To serve me, not with a <span class="libbed">coconut</span>on top<br />
Cause when I bust my <span class="libbed">spleen</span>, I'm raisin up off the cot<br />
Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes<br />
I don't love you <span class="libbed">shovels</span>, I'm out the do'<br />
And I'll be<br />
<span class="libbed">Swimming</span> down the street, smokin indo,<br /><span class="libbed">Gulping</span> on <span class="libbed">beer</span> and juice<br />
Laid back [with my mind on my <span class="libbed">monkey</span> and my <span class="libbed">monkey</span> on my mind]<br />
<span class="libbed">Swimming</span> down the street, smokin indo,span class=”libbed”>Gulping</span> on <span class="libbed">beer</span> and juice
